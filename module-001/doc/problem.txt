Please help! I've made a mess of my downloads folder. This is where my browser 
stores files that I download off the Internet. To make matters worse I like to 
copy movies and music from friends. Normally I just dump these into that same
downloads folder.

I always tell myself that I will sort all the files in downloads later, but it
seems I never get the time. And now there are so many files there, I don't know
what to do.

I have heard that you are a Linux guru, so won't you please help me organize
all the stuff I have in my downloads folder? The files that I care most about 
are movies (mostly in .avi format, but there may be a few in .mkv [matroska] 
format as well) and my music (I have both MP3 and OGG files). I also have a 
collection of ebooks (mostly PDFs but there maybe a few OpenOffice documents 
and MS Word documents there as well).

I download a lot of software. These normally come in .tar.gz packages, but 
some are .tar.bz2 or even .zip format. I'd like to keep all of these inside
a separate folder for packages.

There are some text files (I've named them with a .txt extension) in the folder
as well. Some of these I wrote, some I downloaded. I'd like these in a separate
folder called 'notes'.

Sometimes I save HTML files from the browser. These are mostly temporary files
that I remove once I have finished reading them. You can let them stay in the
downloads folder.

Any other files should not be in the downloads folder and you can safely 
remove them.
