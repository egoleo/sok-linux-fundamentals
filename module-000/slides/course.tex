\frametitle{About this course}
This course will teach you Linux basics. It will not teach you how to administer a Linux server.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Things you need to know}
Before you begin, you will be given the following information:
\begin{itemize}
  \item<1->server IP and/or hostname
  \item<2->username and password
  \item<3->email address
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{SSH}
You will be logging in to the server using the ssh protocol. You will learn
how to log in to the Linux server using your credentials right after this
presentation.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Password}
You should treat your account as if this was a real production server. After
you have logged in to the server you should immediately change your password.
We will show you how to do this. Never share your password with anybody else.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Email}
Your email address is the same as your username. Later today you will learn
how to send and receive emails.
